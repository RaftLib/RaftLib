/**
 * signaldata.hpp - current version only supports single signals,
 * future versions will support more, for right now this is all
 * it really needs to work.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * This class is still largely unused so
 * lets leave the attributes as is. We'll come back and fix once
 * we actually start needing more advanced signaling, or if I'm
 * convinced that we really don't need it (almost am now) then we'll
 * delete this and move on to grander things. - jcb 16May2016
