/**
 * mapbase.hpp - Base map object.  The general idea
 * is that the map object will contain everything needed
 * to construct a streaming topology.  There are two
 * sub-classes.  One is the final "map" topology, the other
 * is the kernel map topology.  The "kernel map" variant
 * has no exe functions nor map checking functions.  It is 
 * assumed that the "kernel map" derivative is contained
 * within a kernel which might have several sub "kernels" 
 * within it.
