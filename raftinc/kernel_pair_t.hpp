/**
 * basic idea here is that we want a return type
 * for the link() function calls as well as the
 * operator += overload on the map that enables
 * return of multiple compute kernels for the
 * user to stitch together in another invocation
 * to add more kernels to the map. What we also 
 * want to ensure is that there is no way for
 * the user to delete one of these kernels which
 * could create for some interesting bugs.
 * the std::pair seems like an obvious choice
 * to return, however creating a container as part
 * of the std::pair is a bit hacky so we'll use the 
 * container directly, the next consideration is what
 * type of container to use inside that std::pair
 * which should be expandable. Again, the obvious
 * choice seems like it should be the std::vector
 * which needs to hold references so they can't
 * be easily deleted..which means we'll have to 
 * use std::reference_wrapper as well.n
