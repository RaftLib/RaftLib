Just a list of stuff that are nice to haves
or things that could be "improved" but are
not necessarily essential for correctness.

* Finish compartmentalization of packages
* add gsl/scotch/shm/systeminfo/papi/hwloc/numactl(linux only)  as sub-modules to build with system
* add homebrew script/macports script to get dependencies for OS X
* finish testing out on Windows
